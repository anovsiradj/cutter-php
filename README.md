# Cutter
**Sharp Like Blade**. LMAO

(another) PHP Template Library. Inspired by Blade (Laravel).

# Installation
Download this source. Also available via [Composer](https://packagist.org/packages/anovsiradj/cutter):
```cmd
composer require anovsiradj/cutter
```

# Usage
The `/example/` is all you need.

To starting using this library, you all need is setting *path* and *layout*.

See demo from localhost: `//localhost/[you-website]/vendor/anovsiradj/cutter/example/` (you need to download it first. i.e: using **Composer**).
