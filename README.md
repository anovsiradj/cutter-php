# Cutter
`Taste Like Blade`. (another) PHP Template Library. Inspired by Blade (Laravel).

# Installation
Download this source. Also available via [Composer](https://packagist.org/packages/anovsiradj/cutter) (dev-master).

To starting using this library, you all need is setting path-to-view and layout(s). See example for more. Easy.
